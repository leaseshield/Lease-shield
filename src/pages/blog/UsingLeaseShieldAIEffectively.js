        Your Lease Shield AI report is typically broken down into key sections. Familiarize yourself with them:
      </Typography>
      <List dense>
          <ListItem>
              <ListItemText primary="Extracted Data:" secondary="Key details like names, addresses, dates, and amounts. Verify these against your knowledge." />
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
              <ListItemText primary="Clause Summaries:" secondary="Plain-language explanations of important clauses (Maintenance, Pets, Termination, etc.). Focus on understanding your rights and obligations." />
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
              <ListItemText primary="Risks / Red Flags:" secondary="Potentially unfavorable or unusual clauses flagged by the AI. Pay close attention to these!" />
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
              <ListItemText primary="Overall Score:" secondary="A general indicator of how tenant-friendly the lease appears. Use it as a guide, not a definitive judgment." />
          </ListItem>
      </List>

      <Box component="figure" sx={{ textAlign: 'center', my: 3 }}>
        <Box
          component="img"
          src="/assets/report-snippet.svg"
          alt="Example Lease Shield AI report showing clause summaries and risk flags."
          sx={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: 1 }}
        />
      </Box>
       <Divider sx={{ my: 3 }} />

      <Typography variant="h2" component="h3" gutterBottom>3. Focus on the Risks</Typography>
      <ListItemIcon sx={{ minWidth: 35, color: 'primary.main' }}><WarningAmber /></ListItemIcon>
      <Typography paragraph>
        The 'Risks' or 'Red Flags' section is often the most valuable. These are areas the AI identified as potentially problematic or non-standard. Don't just glance at them; read the corresponding clause in your actual lease document to understand the full context. These are excellent points to bring up for negotiation or clarification with your landlord or a legal advisor.
      </Typography>

       <Typography variant="h2" component="h3" gutterBottom>4. Use Summaries as a Starting Point</Typography>
       <ListItemIcon sx={{ minWidth: 35, color: 'primary.main' }}><Psychology /></ListItemIcon>
       <Typography paragraph>
         The AI summaries provide a quick understanding, but they condense complex information. If a summary seems particularly important or confusing, always refer back to the original lease language for the exact wording. The AI helps you know *where* to look more closely.
       </Typography>

       <Typography variant="h2" component="h3" gutterBottom>5. AI is a Tool, Not a Lawyer</Typography>
       <ListItemIcon sx={{ minWidth: 35, color: 'primary.main' }}><Gavel /></ListItemIcon>
       <Typography paragraph>
         Lease Shield AI provides powerful insights and significantly speeds up the review process. However, it does not constitute legal advice. For complex situations, high-stakes commercial leases, or if you have significant concerns after reviewing the AI report, always consult with a qualified attorney or legal professional licensed in your jurisdiction.
