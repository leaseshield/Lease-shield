        Signing a new lease is exciting. It’s the key to a new home, a new office, a new beginning. But before you get the keys, there’s the paperwork. A dense, jargon-filled document that stands between you and your new chapter. For most people, it’s a source of stress and uncertainty. Do you really know what you’re signing?

        Traditional lease review is broken. It’s slow, expensive (think lawyer fees of $200–$500/hr), and often inaccessible. Many people sign on the dotted line, simply hoping for the best.
