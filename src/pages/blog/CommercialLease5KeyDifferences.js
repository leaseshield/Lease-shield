        Securing a space for your business is a monumental step. But if you’re approaching a commercial lease with the same mindset as a residential one, you could be walking into a minefield. Commercial leases are far more complex, with higher stakes and significantly fewer legal protections for the tenant.

      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        Understanding these differences is crucial for protecting your business's financial health. While Lease Shield AI is built to analyze both, knowing what to look for is your first line of defense. Here are five key areas where commercial leases diverge from their residential counterparts.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="h2" gutterBottom>1. The "Triple Net" (NNN) Lease</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        In most residential leases, you pay rent, and the landlord covers property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. In the commercial world, the "Triple Net" lease is common. This means you, the tenant, pay for your pro-rata share of property taxes, building insurance, and common area maintenance (CAM) fees on top of your base rent. These costs can be substantial and variable, making it critical to understand how they are calculated.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="h2" gutterBottom>2. Maintenance and Repair Responsibilities</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        Who fixes the air conditioning when it breaks? In a residential lease, it's almost always the landlord. In a commercial lease, the responsibility is often shifted to the tenant. You could be on the hook for everything from plumbing and electrical systems to the HVAC unit. Our AI is trained to flag these clauses, as they represent a significant potential liability for your business.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="h2" gutterBottom>3. Lack of Standardized Forms and Protections</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        Residential leases are often standardized and heavily regulated by consumer protection laws that favor the tenant. Commercial leases are the opposite. They are highly customized contracts between two businesses, and the law assumes both parties are sophisticated negotiators. There are very few "standard" protections, making a thorough review absolutely essential.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="h2" gutterBottom>4. The "Use" Clause</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        A residential lease lets you use the property for "living purposes." A commercial lease contains a "Use Clause" that strictly defines what business activities you can conduct on the premises. If this clause is too narrow, it can restrict your ability to adapt or grow your business. If you want to add a new product line or service, you might be in breach of your lease.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="h2" gutterBottom>5. Transfer and Subletting Rights</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        Need to sell your business or downsize? Transferring a commercial lease is much more complicated than subletting an apartment. The lease may give the landlord the right to deny a transfer for any reason or even to terminate the lease and take the space back, capturing the value of your growing business.
